# Marketing Analysis

The purpose of this project is to showcase my knowledge in performing exploratory data analysis and statistical testing.
The data was obtained from an open public resource (kaggle) and saved to my local drive in `KAG_conversion_data.csv`.
From here I used a juypter notebook to conduct my analysis and statistical tests in `Marketing Campaign Analysis.ipynb` 

The data contains information on three different marketing campaigns including features such as spending, clicks, impressions, and conversions. These were important on determining which campaigns were considered successful in comparison to each other.

Prior to conducting the statistical tests, I had determined if the data statisfies the necessary assumptions for a pair-wise parametric test and if the conditions were not statisfied I proceeded with a non-parametric test. 

Further details and actionable insights obtained from the data may be viewed on the juypter notebook.
